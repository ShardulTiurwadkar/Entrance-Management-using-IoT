# Entrance-Management-using-IoT
The system mainly focuses the avoidance of direct contact of the user with the outsider, to eliminate any possibility that he, the user gets infected. In the vision of such cases, we have proposed a home safety entrance management system that uses face recognition to identify the visitor along with the interfaced sensors that measure the health statistics of the visitor. The system will pass on the identity and health stats of visitor to the owner by and decide whether to allow the visitor in or not.

OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:  
The objectives behind the project are as highlighted below:  
ðŸ”· To study and analyze the existing IoT based entrance management systems.  
ðŸ”· To study and analyze the systems which comprised of automation though communication over the internet.  
ðŸ”· To design an IoT based entrance management system that comprised of face recognition, temperature measurement to record the visitorâ€™s identity and health status.  
ðŸ”· To develop the decision making algorithm that decides whether to open the door or not based on the visitorâ€™s identity and health status
